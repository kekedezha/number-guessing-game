# Challenge Project: Number Guesser

## Description: For this project I used JavaScript functions to power a small guessing game. HTML and CSS were already provided by Codecademy for the project. 4 functions were written in script.js.

### Game: Whoever guesses closer, computer or user, to the random number wins. If both players guess the same number, then the winner of the round goes to the user.
